                <p>In 1959 / 1960 the Posthouse was the first purpose built hotel at the airport and was owned by Lyons, Britain’s largest and most prominent food manufacturing, restaurant and hotel company. Responding pragmatically to a dynamic emerging situation in which new modes of transport were quickly usurping domestic rail travel and international sea travel, while possibly reasoning that air passengers, many coming from abroad, would have more spending power than </p>
                
                <p>British motorists, J. Lyons decided that, rather than building a motel on their land, they would instead develop Britain’s first dedicated airport hotel. Their site was, after all, right next to London Airport’s main runway and at the time plans had just been announce to expand the airport which would coincide with the opening of London Airport’s Oceanic Terminal. This was developed specifically to handle long-haul international flights and commissioned in 1961 (nowadays, this is Heathrow Terminal 3). </p>

                <p>Good Afternoon,

                    Just want to say thank you to Sarah, Josh and the team for a great dining experience last night, despite the restrictions now imposed.
                    
                    We are regulars, but to be honest we haven’t been since the 10pm curfew started as we thought it just wouldn’t be the same!
                    
                    But we were pleasantly surprised!
                    
                    The food was delicious, staff did really well, even with the masks and we were thrilled to have been given the option to move to the lounge for drinks when our table was required,  rather than being shown the door. Sincerely, Janet Jones</p>

                <p>I just wanted to say what a wonderful afternoon we had yesterday. The marquee was breath-taking ( I actually got quite emotional when we walked in) and the champagne by the river was perfect. We had such a special day and we are so glad we decided to book. The food was absolutely amazing and the staff couldn’t do enough for us.

                    We will definitely be back next year and we are now even more looking forward to the BBQ and Jazz evening in August.
                    
                    I will also keep my eye out for other events as I’m sure myself and my friends would like to arrange something at some point.
                    
                    Can you please thank all the staff involved for what was one of the best afternoons we have ever had.
                    
                    Kind regards,
